function sections = LongMultiMovieSplitAnalysis_parameters(movies,MaxSectionSize,newmovies,framegap,varargin)
%LONGMULTIMOVIESPLITANALYSIS Analyze multiple long movies at once.
%   Inputs:
%       movies: Cell array of strings of the file path of movies.
%       MaxSectionSize: Largest sections allowed to be analyzed. Movies
%           will be equally dividied into multiple parts such that the size
%           of each is under the MaxSectionSize. Can put 'inf' to just get
%           one section.
%       newmovies: Cell array of strings of the file path of new movies.
%           (Yes, even if movies don't need to be split in parts they are
%           still copied to a new location. This analysis is not friendly
%           to hard drive space.)
%       framegap: A vector containing the frame rates of all the movies.
%           cmeAnalysis supposedly uses this in its analysis.
%   Outputs:
%       sections: A vector of the number of sections for each movie. Used
%           as input for LongMoviePostCME_osc.
% This code will rarely need to be run on its own as comb_run takes care of
% most of the details. Still, if you are used to working with the results
% of cmeAnalysis this can be a tool to run multiple long movies if you don't
% already have a tool for that.
